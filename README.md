# e-commerce-application-follow-along


Key Features of the Project:

In this project, I will be building an E-Commerce app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here is what I will be learning and working on:

REST API Creation: I will learn how to build scalable APIs to manage users, products, and orders, and get hands-on experience with backend development.

User Authentication: I will implement secure login and registration for users, which is a crucial part of any app that handles sensitive data.

Database Schema Design: I will explore MongoDB to design data models that are efficient and scalable for an e-commerce platform.

Backend Development: I will set up a server with Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, API routes, and interact with the database.

Frontend with React: I will use React to build dynamic, user-friendly interfaces, like product lists and shopping carts.

Milestone 3: In this milestone the is code sets up an Express.js server with error handling and database connection. Key components include:

1.Error Handling: Custom error handler (ErrorHandler class) manages specific errors like CastError, duplicate keys, and JWT-related errors.
2. Environment Configuration: Uses .env for configuration in non-production environments.
3. Database Connection: Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
4. Global Error Handling: Handles uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections gracefully.
5. Server Setup: Starts the server on a specified port.
The code integrates these features into a robust backend structure.
